    "answer : The function used to open a file in Python is the built-in open() function. This function takes at least one argument, which is the name of the file to be opened, and returns a file object which can be used to read from or write to the file.\n",
    "The mode parameter is optional and is used to specify the mode in which the file should be opened. There are several different modes in which a file can be opened, each of which determines how the file can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (read mode): This mode is used to open a file for reading. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file, and if the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (write mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file exists, it is truncated to zero length, otherwise a new file is created. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (append mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing, but the new data is written to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file, but raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (binary mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files such as images, videos, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (text mode): This mode is used to open a file in text mode, which is used for text files such as .txt files. This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+' (read and write mode): This mode is used to open a file for both reading and writing.\n",

    "For example, to open a file named \"example.txt\" in read mode, you would use the following code:\n",
    "file_object = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n"
